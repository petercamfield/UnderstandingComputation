Understanding Computation (in JavaScript)
=========================================

A group of us are going through Tom Stuart's Understanding Computation book week-by-week and re-writing the examples in JavaScript. 
The motivation is partly to learn the content of the book and partly to understand JavaScript a little better.

We have covered the book to assignment e.g. x = x + 1. On the JS front we have looked at classical JS with the new keyword and Crockford style object creation.
